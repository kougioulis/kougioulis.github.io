Hi 👋, I'm **Nikolas**. 

I am a Research Fellow at <a href='https://www.forth.gr/en/home/' target='_blank'>Foundation for Research & Technology Hellas (FORTH)</a> in Heraklion, affilated with the <a href=''>MensXMachina</a> group under the direction of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7fendUwAAAAJ' target='_blank'>Ioannis Tsamardinos</a>, <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/softriant/home/' target='_blank'>Sofia Triantafillou</a> and <a href='https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Vassilis.Christophides/' target='_blank'>Vassilis Christophides</a>. I concurrently pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Crete. My broad interests involve Causality, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

Currently, I work on the intersection between Causal Discovery methods and Deep Learning, in both theoretical and practical aspects. Previously, I obtained my degree in <a href='https://www.auth.gr/en/school/math-en/' target='_blank'>Mathematics</a> from <a href ='https://www.auth.gr/en/' target='_blank'>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</a>. I speak 🇬🇷, 🇬🇧 and 🇫🇷.

My time is spent between <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki' target='_blank'>Thessaloniki</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraklion' target='_blank'>Heraklion</a>. I also enjoy learning 📚, teaching, travelling (inside and out), weightlifting 🏋️ and indoor rowing 🚣. I also hold an everliving passion for motorsport and British classic cars.
